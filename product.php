The iPhone is a smartphone developed description by Apple. The first iPhone was released in June, 2007 and an updated version has been released roughly every year since then. While the iPhone was originally only available to AT&T customers, the iPhone 4 was released on the Verizon network in February, 2010.

The iPhone has a sleek, minimalist design, and differs from other smartphones in its lack of buttons. Most operations on the iPhone are performed using the touch screen display. The only physical buttons include a sleep/wake button, a mute switch, volume up/down buttons, and a home button. All versions of the iPhone have a rear-facing camera, but the iPhone 4 introduced a front-facing camera, which can be used for video calls made using the FaceTime feature. The iPhone 4 also included the first 960 x 640 pixel "retina display," which has double the resolution of previous iPhone displays.</p>
